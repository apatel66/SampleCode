Here are a few programs written by me to provide a brief overview of my coding style
- Click on each folder and the file indside to view the code
- Descriptions for each program are commented at the top of each code

### Try My Programs Out!
If you would like to try some of my programs out, here is how you can run them on a Command Line Interface:

1. Click the green "Clone or download" button on the right and then click "Download ZIP". This will download a folder called    
   "SampleCode-master" into your downloads folder
2. Open up a new command line and enter the following to change your directory into the "SampleCode" folder
```
$ cd Downloads/SampleCode-master
```
3. Enter `ls` to view the various program folders
4. Enter `cd` + the folder name to go into the folder. The folders will all start with "USACO".
   TIP: If you have typed enough characters, press `TAB` and the rest of the word will fill in given you are in the right 
   directory
5. Enter `ls` to view the files inside the folder. There should be a c++ file, an input file and a textfile containing the 
   output. For eaxmple, if I was in the `USACOChecker` folder, I would see `checker.cpp`, `checker.in`, and 
   `checkerOutput.txt`.
6. To compile the program enter the following code. Remember, even though you can enter any word in place of "example", 
   "problemName" has to be the exact file name of the program
```
$ g++ -o example problemName.cpp
```
7. Now to run the program, enter:
```
$ ./example
```
8. An output should appear. To compare what was printed with the real answers, enter this command:
```
$ open problemNameOutput.txt
```
   This will open a text file of the correct answer. Check to see if my program works!
